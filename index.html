              <h3>Quantifying our state's fire needs</h3>
              <br>
              <p>This assessment quantifies the state of Wisconsin’s fire “needs”, or the amount of prescribed fire needed to conserve fire-dependent natural communities in Wisconsin. </p> 
              
              <p> Government agencies, conservation nonprofits, private contractors, volunteer groups and private landowners all play a role in the resilience of Wisconsin’s natural lands. The intricate mix of players presents a unique challenge to implementing conservation at the scale required to meet climate resilience. Since many of Wisconsin’s natural plant communities are fire-dependent, prescribed fire is a critical component of meeting conservation goals in the future. </p>
                <br>
              <p style="font-size: 16px"><b>This assessment serves as a benchmark for the conservation community to quantify the gap between current fire application and needed fire application in the State of Wisconsin.</b></p>
                <br>
              <p>This assessment provides an update to the 2014 Wisconsin Fire Needs Assessment <a href="http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubs/SILVIS/Hmielowski_etal_2016_EcologicalApplications.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Hmielowski et al, 2016).</a> The assessment seeks to quantify current prescribed fire needs, and offer an approach to prioritizing application of prescribed fire based on ecological benefit, feasibilty, and management effort. The fire needs assessment utilizes national-wide datasets, such that the Wisconsin fire needs assessment can be used as a template for fire needs assessments in other regions of the United States. Read our <a href="/methodology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">methodology </a>for a step-by-step guide to performing the fire needs assessment, and to access associated scripts. </p>

            <p>Fire severity is measured as the percent of above-ground biomass killed following a fire. A low-severity fire is defined as less than 25 percent average top-kill for a given vegetation type; mixed-severity as between 25 and 75 percent top-kill; and a replacement fire as greater than 75% top-kill.  Fire severity is not a proxy for fire intensity, which describes fire behavior such as rate of spread or flame length. Fire severity, as defined by LANDFIRE, measures the mortality of a fire. A fire consuming 80% of the above-ground fuels in a grassland would be considered a “replacement” fire. A fire consuming 80% of grasses within an oak forest, but  only killing 20% of the total above-ground biomass for that ecosystem, would be considered a low-severity or “surface” fire. </p>
            <p> Across Wisconsin, typical fire severity ranged greatly depending on ecosystem type. The high prevalence of replacement fire in the southwest part of the state was attributed to grassland communities, where the majority of grass fuels were consumed and killed during a burn.</p>
            <p>Forested areas experienced fires of all severities, with conifer-dominated communities more likely to experience replacement fires, and hardwood-dominated forests more likely to experience surface fires.  </p>
            <p>Across all communities, the most commonly occurring fire type were fires of low or mixed severity, i.e. surface fires. </p>

The graph displays the relative proportions of each fire severity for ecosystems grouped by physiognomy (e.g. riparian, grassland, etc.).  </figcaption>

            <br><br>
            <p>Wisconsin’s landscape has dramatically changed due to human pressure on the landscape including agricultural land use, logging, development and urbanization, and hydrologic modification, primarily in the last 200 years.   </p> 
            <p>Despite these impacts, nearly 58% of Wisconsin land retains natural plant cover. Many natural communities, however, are severely degraded (departed from historical biodiversity) due to indirect human impacts including invasive exotic species, suppression of historic fire regimes, change in hydrology, livestock grazing, and loss of diversity due to direct and indirect effects of climate change, among other impacts. Reintroduction of ecological processes, such as fire, offers one of the most effective management strategies for restoring biodiversity back to Wisconsin's natural communities.

            <p>To maintain the current extent of natural area, we estimate over 800,000 acres burned annually. Managed grasslands and ruderal grasslands constitute a large opportunity for habitat restoration. However, management with prescribed burning should be evaluated within the context of other management practices already occurring, such as managed grazing and mowing. Following grassland communities, forest communities offer a large prescribed fire need by acreage despite moderate fire return intervals. Dry-mesic oak forests, for example, have an estimated mean fire return interval of 24 years, but due to its vast abundance on the landscape, requires an estimated ~100,000 acres burned annually to mimic historical burn frequency.

            <p>While estimations of prescribed fire needs are helpful in understanding the relative magnitude required to sustain natural communities, the LANDFIRE model products are, “not a prescription for how things should be today or tomorrow” <a href="https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/FireLandscapes/LANDFIRE/Documents/WEBINAR_Sarah_IL%20Fire%20Needs%20Assessment_May%202016_notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Hagen 2016)</a>. </p>

            <p>Conservationists strive to <i>restore</i> natural communities to more closely resemble historical composition when the historical composition provides greater biodiversity. Future revisions of the Fire Needs Assessment should incorporate expert opinion and best able science to better predict current fire regimes needed to <i>restore</i> natural communities. </p>

            <h3> Future Analysis </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Further analysis will help prioritize <i>where</i> best to apply fire.  Application of prescribed fire can be prioritized based on potential ecological benefit.  On a landscape scale, we can consider ecological rarity as a metric of how endangered a community is. By identifying communities with high rarity and frequent fire return intervals, we can determine the communities that are most threatened by fire suppression.</p>

            <p> After determining the highest priority areas for prescribed fire application for ecological benefit, we will incorporate the effort and feasibility of performing prescribed fire. Management effort captures resources needed to adequately manage frequently burned vegetation by considering the number of individual units (patches of fire-dependent vegetation) and the required number of fire applications. Feasibility of prescribed fire application considers proximity of fire-dependent patches to developed areas, assuming that patches closer to developed areas have a lower probability of successfully maintaining ecological value. By combining indices of maximum ecological benefit, management effort, and management feasibility, we will present a comprehensive prioritization scheme for prescribed burning application.</p>
